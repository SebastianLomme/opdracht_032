Instructions


* simply boil the cashews for the cheese sauce for 10 minutes if you can’t soak overnight
Method;
For the lentil bolognese;
Finely chop the scallions and finely slice the chilli into small pieces. Finely chop the fresh tomatoes. Drain and rinse the can of lentils. Heat a large non-stick pan on a high heat with 1 tbsp of oil, once the pan heats up, add the scallions/ spring onions, half the chopped chilli and 1/2 tsp of salt. Cook for 2 mins stirring regularly. If the veg starts to stick add 1 tsp of water and loosen with a wooden spoon. Next, add all the fresh tomatoes, a pinch of salt and stir well, add the drained and rinsed lentils, maple syrup, tamari and cook for a further 1 minute.. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil. Once it boils, reduce to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your pallet. If you do have more time let it reduce for longer to allow the flavours to concentrate and come together more.
While the lentils are simmering time to prepare the cashew cheese/queso and quick guacamole.
To make the cashew cheese; Drain and rinse the soaked softened cashews and add along with all the other cheese ingredients to a blender with the 125mll of fresh water and blend until very smooth.
For the guac; Destone the avocados and roughly chop and add to a bowl with the juice of the limes, half the fresh coriander (keep a little for garnish), a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and mash together to your desired Guacamole texture.
To layer up your nachos ;
On a large plate or platter, add a single layer of chips, cover with a layer of lentils, drizzle a third of the cashew queso over the lentils, dot a few spoons of guacamole over the queso. repeat with another layer of corn chips, lentils, queso and guacamole, and then a final smaller layer, finish by garnishing with some coriander and fresh chillies.
